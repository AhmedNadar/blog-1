I love Chuck Norris. And most of all, I love nerdy Chuck Norris Jokes.

{% img right /images/2013-02-22-chuck-norris.jpg 400 Chuck Norris doesn't write code %}

A few days ago, one of my colleagues sent me a link about a [ChuckNorrisException](http://criso.github.com/ChuckNorrisException/) and got me browsing through the web searching for more Chuck Norris developer jokes.
After looking for ["chuck norris" on github](https://github.com/search?q=chuck+norris&ref=commandbar), I found the [Internet Chuck Norris Data Base](http://www.icndb.com/), which contains hundreds of Chuck Norris jokes separated into categories, and has a RESTful API.

*Bingo!*

I thought it would be great to have random jokes on my blog. I didn't find any plugin in the [Octopress plugins list](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins), so I started developing one straight away.

### And Octopress-Chuck-Norris was born

*Ta-daaah!*

You can see it working in this blog on the upper right corner, and you can download it on its [github page](https://github.com/alestanis/octopress-chuck-norris).

Isn't it sweet?

### Bonus

Here are some other resources I found. Only Chuck Norris can read these at work without laughing out loud.

 - [Java and Chuck Norris](http://radu.cotescu.com/java-and-chuck-norris/)
 - [The Ultimate Top 25 Chuck Norris “The Programmer” Jokes](http://codesqueeze.com/the-ultimate-top-25-chuck-norris-the-programmer-jokes/)
 - [Chuck Norris Facts](http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/)
 - and... [Jon Skeet Facts](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/9134/jon-skeet-facts) (the accepted answer is from Jon Skeet himself!)

 Enjoy!
