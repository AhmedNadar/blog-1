It's been a year or so since I first thought about starting a blog. And then there was work, family and more work, and time flew by without me even noticing. Then a friend told me about [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), so I checked it out.

Hmm... Blogging framework for hackers, Ruby, Heroku, markup and one-line deloyment? Sounds great!

In less than an hour I had cloned Octopress, bought my domain, linked it to Heroku and deployed my beautifully empty blog. Yay! This *is* blogging for hackers.
