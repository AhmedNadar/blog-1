Besides from the fact that saying "bang bang" makes me think of Quentin Tarantino (because of Bang bang → Nancy Sinatra → Kill Bill), which makes it already a hyper-classy command, I love "bang bang" because it's *also* one of the most useful commands of all times.

## Behold the power of bang-bang

The bang bang command lets you execute the last command you launched from your shell, which is very useful when you need permissions to do something:

*Ooooh*, you don't want to create that file? *BAM!* `sudo bang bang`!

Here's another one, for my Ruby-on-Rails friends out there: `bundle exec bang bang`

Yay!
